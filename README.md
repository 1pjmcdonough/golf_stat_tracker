# Golf Round Tracker

This is a web-based tool for tracking golf rounds hole by hole. It lets you enter stats like fairways hit, greens in regulation, putts, bunkers, penalties, and score for each hole. You can save each hole individually, view a live summary of your round, and store past rounds for later review.

All data is saved locally in your browser, so there's no need to sign in or connect to anything. You can choose a course and date, move through holes, and use simple buttons to update stats. There's also a history table to view or delete previous rounds.

The app runs entirely in the browser and is designed to be lightweight and easy to use.
